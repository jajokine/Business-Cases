# Business-Cases
Exploring various business cases by using a wide range of statistical methods, visualization and machine learning techniques to analyze and solve each problem.

The first case involves A/B testing which consists of a randomized and controlled experiment with two variants, A and B, that allow to form a causal relationship with high probability in order to determine which of the two variants is more effective. For a business, this sort of testing gives valuable information when something new is being implemented and we want to know whether this implementation is worthwhile or we should stick to the old version or perhaps try something else. This could be, for example, when we try to understand user engagement and user satisfaction of online features such as a new feature or product. This analysis that utilizes statistical methods of hypothese testing allows companies to better understand growth, increase revenue, and optimize customer satisfaction. They are therefore an indispensable tool for many large companies, but also for smaller companies and startups by combining with Agile software development or through Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). The file [a_b_testing.ipynb](https://github.com/jajokine/Business-Cases/blob/main/a_b_testing.ipynb) is the Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code, visualizations and analysis of the project.

The second case deals with customer churn prediction. The churn rate is a critical metric for customer satisfaction and for measuring growth, as it tells you how many existing customers are leaving your business. By managing to lower the churn rate, we can have an impact on the business revenues and growth potential. Predicting the customer churn is especially important for Software as a Service (SaaS) business models that have subscription- and membership-based customers that use the services of a company frequently, but are in a sector where there are other companies that offer similar services, so predicting the customer satisfaction through the customer churn becomes a critical factor in order to succeed.  The file [customer_churn_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/jajokine/Business-Cases/blob/main/customer_churn_prediction.ipynb) is the Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code, visualizations and analysis of the project.

The third case will explore customer segmentation. Two different models will segment the customers into groups in order to compare the results to see how the results differ and how the results should be interpreted. First, we will use the RFM (Recency Frequency Monetary Value) model to differentiate customers based on a score that tries to predict future behavior, and afterwards, implement some unsupervised machine learning techniques that cluster the customers into segments without creating any specific score or label from the customers.

The forth case involves the prediction of housing prices. There will be data from a housing market with a set of variables and the goal will be to find a model that predicts the price of a house as accurately as possible. Moreover, the model needs be made so that it is able to fetch new data to a database, make an update based on the new data, and provide a way for a user to make the price predictions as easily as possible.
